  <title>Tasks - Test Project</title>
<head>

<body>

<ul>
  <li>Learn how to use Git - Google Git cheatsheet, common commands etc.</li>
  <li>Either get familiar with Vim or start using a proper IDE, I recommend looking into Sublime Text or PhpStorm or even Notepad++ to just begin with, do some research if you need to.</li>
  <li>In your new Test project, get a proper directory setup going, one for images, another for fonts, another for styles and then your html files will be in the root directory e.g. test/index.html and test/styles/main.css.</li>
  <li>In your index.html (main file that will load up, start setting up a proper HTML5 template with CSS3 from a stylesheet in styles/<whatever>.css.</li>
  <li>Get a template theme going on, by learning more about HTML5 and CSS3, if you want to copy something else then go ahead, but edit it as much as you can to keep it simple... in any case, we need a side navigation, a banner with top navigation, and content in the middle along with a footer with some copyright stuff and links e.g. contact, sitemap etc.</li>
  <li>At the end of this you should have a very basic website setup and running with a template consistent across all (the nav, header, footer, content etc.).  It can be about anything you want, any subject or topic.</li>
  <li>Bonus: If possible, find a way to not have to copy and paste the template into every file to retain the same look.  Do not use iFrames... and do not use PHP at all yet... just HTML5/CSS3, and a way of including the template in each 'content' file which grabs the nav/header/footer etc. from perhaps a templates/ folder? But no worries if you get stuck.  Definitely try to come up with your own CSS file from scratch and play around with the index.html - that way you have complete control over your design.  Good luck!</li>
